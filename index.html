                    <h4>Walter White</h4>
                    <p>Walter Hartwell "Walt" White Sr., also known by his clandestine pseudonym and business moniker Heisenberg and also frequently referred to as Mr. White, is an American former chemist and major narcotics distributor from Albuquerque, New Mexico, whose drug empire became the largest meth operation in American history, surpassing both Gustavo Fring's drug empire and the Cartel's. Before entering the drug trade, Walt was a respected chemist and scientist who later worked as an overqualified high school chemistry teacher at J. P. Wynne High School alongside working at the A1A Car Wash to financially support his family (his wife Skyler, son Walt Jr., and infant daughter Holly). After being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, Walt started manufacturing chemically pure crystal methamphetamine to provide for his family upon his death. Knowing nothing about the drug trade, Walt enlisted the aid of his former student, Jesse Pinkman, to sell the meth he produced.

                       <br><br> Walt's scientific knowledge and dedication to quality lead him to produce crystal meth that is purer and more potent than any competitors. To avoid the tedious collection of pseudoephedrine required for production, Walt devises an alternative chemical process utilizing methylamine, giving his product a distinctive blue colour. His crystal meth, which is given the street name "Blue Sky," dominates the market, leading to confrontations with established drug makers and dealers. Although Walt and Jesse began as amateur small-time meth cooks, manufacturing the drug out of an RV in the deserts of New Mexico, and being met with very limited success, Walt and Jesse soon climbed up the drug hierarchy, killing or systematically destroying anyone who impeded them. Because of his drug-related activities, Walt eventually finds himself at odds with his family, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) through his brother-in-law and accomplished DEA agent Hank Schrader, the local gangs, and the Mexican drug cartels (including their regional distributors), putting him and his family's lives at risk.</p>

                    <h4>Jesse Pinkman</h4>
                    <p>Jesse Bruce Pinkman, also known by his clandestine pseudonym and business moniker Cap'n Cook, is a former chemist, manufacturer, and distributor who worked in Albuquerque, New Mexico, currently residing in Haines, Alaska. Originally a low-level methamphetamine dealer who worked with his friend and fellow meth cook Emilio Koyama, Jesse is best known as the former business and meth cook partner of his former chemistry teacher Walter White, teaming up with Walt for two years to help him manufacture chemically pure crystal methamphetamine so Walt could provide for his family (his wife Skyler, son Walt Jr., and infant daughter Holly) upon his death. Alongside catalyzing Walt's drug empire and being the second biggest player in it after Walt himself, Jesse and Walt were also the leaders of a short-lived meth distribution chain which his friends and fellow meth distributors were also a part of.

                        <br><br>Jesse was born into an upper middle-class family in Albuquerque (consisting of his father Adam, mother Diane, brother Jake, and aunt Ginny), but unfortunately his relationship with his parents would often become strained due to his frequent drug use, which later resulted in Jesse being kicked out of the Pinkman home. In high school, Jesse was an indifferent student in Walt's chemistry class at J. P. Wynne High School, though despite his poor academic standing, was able to graduate and received a diploma. During his adulthood, Jesse became impulsive and hedonistic, but was financially ambitious and streetwise. He talked in playful slang, played video games, listened to rap and rock music, took recreational drugs, and drove lowriders. His closest friends in Albuquerque were fellow small-time drug users and dealers Skinny Pete, Brandon "Badger" Mayhew, and Christian "Combo" Ortega. Jesse worked as a small-time meth dealer and distributor with Emilio and his cousin Domingo "Krazy-8" Molina before he was enlisted by Walt, who at that point knew nothing about the Albuquerque drug trade, to sell the meth he produced.</p>

    <h4>Gustavo Fring</h4>
    <p>Gustavo "Gus" Fring, mockingly referred to as The Chicken Man by Hector, is a Chilean-American restaurant entrepreneur and major narcotics distributor who primarily worked in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Originally collaborating with the Mexican drug cartel to distribute cartel cocaine, Gus eliminated his dependence on the cartel and began distributing methamphetamine himself, and eventually became the kingpin of his solo drug empire, which was the most successful drug operation in United States history until his former employee Walter White surpassed it with his own drug empire.

        <br><br>Gus is the proprietor of Los Pollos Hermanos, a highly successful fried chicken restaurant chain which he co-founded with his business associate and romantic partner Maximino "Max" Arciniega, and is also the owner of the industrial laundry facility called Lavander√≠a Brillante. Gus uses both of these stores as a front for his meth distribution operation throughout the American southwest, supported by Los Pollos' corporate owners, Madrigal Electromotive GmbH.
        
        <br><br>Gus maintains a positive public image; he is a booster for Albuquerque civic causes, including the local Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) office; in addition to befriending the special agent in charge, Gus makes large donations to the office's charitable events, and is a member of the hospital board. Underneath this outwardly pleasant front, he is ruthless, cruel, and Machiavellian in managing his drug empire, using his anti-drug philanthropy to conceal his true nature from the public. He employs a number of enforcers including Mike Ehrmantraut, and has personally killed both rivals and allies.</p>

    <p>James Morgan "Jimmy" McGill, better known by his professional alias and business moniker Saul Goodman, is an American criminal defense lawyer, scam artist, and convicted criminal who is serving an 86-year sentence at ADX Montrose. Originally from Cicero, Illinois during his career as a scam artist, Jimmy moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico where he worked as a lawyer, and later resided as a fugitive in Omaha, Nebraska before being caught and apprehended in a federal prison at Montrose, Colorado. During his law career, Jimmy embraced his tendencies as a former scam artist and, after becoming a dedicated and effective criminal lawyer, he began to represent criminals while he himself became increasingly involved in the city's criminal underworld, all the while slowly losing his morality along the way. Despite his flamboyant appearance and mannerisms, Saul was a highly competent lawyer who was able to solve problems and find loopholes in order to protect his clients. His business name, "Saul Goodman," is a play on the phrase "it's all good, man."</p>

He worked for both Gustavo Fring and Saul Goodman as a private investigator, head of security, cleaner, fixer, and hitman. Mike has extensive knowledge of how to operate on both sides of the law without detection. As a former beat cop and true professional, Mike maintains an extensive, up-to-date knowledge of forensic evidence, surveillance equipment, and police procedure. Mike is also well-trained and calm in all types of combat situations, once using science and long strategy to take down a large number of hostiles with ease.

        <br><br>Born between 1940-1944, Mike served in the Marines during the Vietnam War. While in Philadelphia, he married and had a son, Matt, who later had his own family, wife Stacey and daughter Kaylee. Mike got caught up in crooked activities within the Philadelphia police, and after Matt joined the force, he hesitated when two crooked cops approached him, so they killed him. After Matt's funeral, Mike murdered the two cops, then fled to Albuquerque to be near Stacey and Kaylee. He took a job as a parking lot attendant at the Bernalillo County Courthouse and also performed for-hire criminal jobs on the side.</p>

            Jesse Pinkman was originally slated to be written out by the 9th episode. During the hiatus caused by the writers' strike, creator Vince Gilligan, impressed by Aaron Paul's portrayal of Jesse, decided to reinstate the character.
        </div>
        <div class="fact-item">
        After binge-watching the entire show in a span of two weeks, Sir Anthony Hopkins wrote a glowing fan letter to Bryan Cranston, praising him and his fellow actors for their incredible acting, as well as lauding the rest of the crew, comparing the series to a "great Shakespearian or Greek tragedy."
        </div>
        <div class="fact-item">
            It was Vince Gilligan's decision to finish the show in season 5. He didn't want to make the mistake many successful shows make by running too long until the quality decreases.        </div>
        <div class="fact-item">
            RJ Mitte has cerebral palsy in real life. His case is much milder than Walt Junior's. He had to learn to walk with crutches and slow down his speech to play the part.        </div>
        <div class="fact-item">
            Many fans were surprised that such a successful show had stars who weren't very famous. Vince Gilligan said that this was by choice, and as the show went on he actually rejected big-name stars in favor of lesser-known actors.        </div>
        <div class="fact-item">
            When characters on the show are smoking meth, they are actually smoking sugar or rock candy without inhaling. The candy meth is produced by The Candy Lady, a local business in Albuquerque.        </div>
        <div class="fact-item">
            The Whites' address, 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, is a private residence. The residents have had to deal with fans recreating Walter's famous pizza throw onto the roof of their house, and have conducted media interviews asking to be left alone.        </div>
        <div class="fact-item">
            When one of Tuco's two cousins was cast, he was asked if he knew of anyone who looked similar, with a strong physique and the same intensity. He recommended his brother, who got the role immediately.        </div>
        <div class="fact-item">
            In an interview, Vince Gilligan admitted that the writers' strike that shortened season 1 ended up benefiting the show. He'd planned for Walt's evil side to emerge in a shocking season finale. The strike led him to write the evolution much more gradually.        </div>
        <div class="fact-item">
            Walter was originally written to be 40 years old. AMC felt that 40 was too young for Walter to have a mid-life crisis and requested his age change to 50.        </div>
